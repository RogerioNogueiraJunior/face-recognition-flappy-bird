# face-recognition-flappy-bird
using the libraries, pygame, opencv and random, i was able to do a little flappy bird game which you play with your face

to work properly you have to install the used libraries, and have a onboard webcam, never tested with periferal webcams

My project uses the Open Source Computer Vision Library provided by Intel, and was made only for study purposes
